# 🔍 AI-Powered User Churn Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts which users are likely to stop using a SaaS product, based on behavior and usage data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 Upload CSV files of user activity (e.g., from your SaaS platform)
- 🔍 Predict user churn using a pre-trained Random Forest model
- 📊 Visualize key factors that influence churn
- 🖥️ Simple Flask-based web interface for predictions

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **ML & Data:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Joblib
- **Frontend:** HTML (Jinja2 Templates)

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This will save the trained model to `app/model/churn_model.pkl`.

> 🔧 **Note:** If `churn_model.pkl` is not included in this repo, you must generate it by running `train_model.py`.

### 3️⃣ Start the Flask App
```bash
cd app
python app.py
```
Then open your browser and go to:  
`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## 📊 Dataset

We use the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) which contains customer usage behavior and contract details.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add SHAP or LIME interpretability for feature importance
- Integrate model retraining pipeline
- Dockerize the full app
